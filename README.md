# discord-slash-dm
"DM" a user through slash commands

## why?
- Because sometimes I don't want to open up my DMs to receive "private" information and disallowing read history isn't enough.

## Environment Variables
`WEBHOOK_URL` - Webhook to send response to  
`CLIENT_ID` - From bot portal  
`CLIENT_PUBLIC_KEY` - From bot portal
